## üìú Introduction

Air quality is vital for our health and well-being. With the **Windy** device, you can monitor air quality in real-time. This project combines various technologies, including sensors, microcontrollers, and mobile applications. 

## üåü Features

- Real-time air quality monitoring
- User-friendly mobile application for Android and iOS
- Open-source design for easy customization
- 3D-printed housing for a sleek look
- Easy-to-follow instructions

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with the **Windy** project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/felpsSS/Windy.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**
   ```bash
   cd Windy
   ```

3. **Check the Documentation**
   Refer to the `docs` folder for detailed instructions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Components

To build the **Windy** device, you will need the following components:

- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: This will be the brain of your device.
- **Air Quality Sensor**: Choose a sensor that meets your needs (e.g., MQ-135).
- **Power Supply**: Ensure you have a reliable power source.
- **3D Printed Case**: You can find the design files in the `3D-Print` folder.

### Recommended Components

| Component          | Description                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| ESP32              | Dual-core microcontroller        |
| MQ-135 Sensor      | Measures air quality             |
| Battery Pack       | For portable use                 |
| Jumper Wires       | For connections                  |

## üíª Software Setup

The software setup involves several steps:

1. **Install the Arduino IDE**: Download from the [official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. **Install ESP32 Board Support**: Follow the instructions in the Arduino IDE to add ESP32 support.
3. **Upload the Code**: Open the `Windy.ino` file and upload it to your ESP32.

### Libraries Required

Make sure to install the following libraries in the Arduino IDE:

- `DHT sensor library`
- `WiFi library`
- `HTTPClient library`

## üñ®Ô∏è 3D Printing

To create the housing for your **Windy** device, you will need to 3D print the case. The STL files are located in the `3D-Print` folder. 

### Printing Guidelines

- **Material**: Use PLA or ABS for durability.
- **Layer Height**: 0.2 mm for a good balance of quality and speed.
- **Infill**: 20% should be sufficient.

## üì± Mobile Application

The **Windy** mobile application is available for both Android and iOS. It allows you to monitor air quality data from your device.

### Features of the App

- Real-time data display
- Historical data tracking
- Alerts for poor air quality
- User-friendly interface

### Installation

You can download the mobile app from the respective app stores. 

## üõ†Ô∏è PCB Design

The PCB design files are included in the repository. You can modify them as needed. 

### Design Software

We recommend using KiCAD or Eagle for PCB design.
